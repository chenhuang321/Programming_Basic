				<h2>Brands in Paris</h2>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Paris is one of the finest cities in the world for shopping, and we do have some favorite streets and stores.  Yet, there are so many great books 
				and articles about where to shop in Paris that my information could never be complete or up-to-the-minute.  Anyway, part of the fun is discovering all
				the new boutiques and trends!<a href="http://www.parisperfect.com/paris-shopping-guide.php" target="_blank" title="shopping in paris">

				<h3>Top Brands in Paris</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>LOUIS VUITTON</strong><br/>
						<strong>Last year's ranking</strong>: 1<br/>
						<strong>Overall Brand Value</strong>: up 2% to $19.78 billion<br/>
						Louis Vuitton's focus on its heritage as a travel brand helped it to retain its core customer--the jet setter.

					<li><strong>CHANEL</strong><br/>
						<strong>Last year's ranking</strong>: 4<br/>
					    <strong>Overall Brand Value</strong>: down 11% to $5.55 billion<br/>
						Chanel's dip in brand value is a sign of the times, according to Millward Brown Optimor director Pierre Dupreelle. During the recession, 
						consumers turned to more practical products. While Chanel still attracted many with its classic quilted bags, cosmetics and fragrances, those 
						determined to buy just a few investment pieces stayed away from the ready-to-wear. However, Dupreelle feels that consumers are looking for some
						newness in 2010, which Karl Lagerfeld always brings to the runway. He predicts the fashion house will see an uptick over the next couple of years.

				<h3>Paris Emerges as a Fashion Capital</h3>
				<p>Prior to the rise of the modern nation-state fashions were geographically dispersed, with loci in Florence and other powerful Italian city-states as 
				well as at the courts of Burgundy and Spain. But France emerged from the end of the Thirty Years' War, in 1648, as by far the largest, richest, and most
				powerful state in Europe, and the rulers of France-most notably Louis XIV (reigned 1643-1715)-understood that fashion was a potent weapon in establishing
				France's cultural preeminence. Louis XIV exercised control over his aristocrats by requiring that all who were in attendance at his new court at Versailles
				be dressed in appropriate fashions. At the same time the king's chief minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, recognized the growing economic importance of textiles 
				and clothing and harnessed the power of the state to France's fashion leadership.<br/>

				<h3>Paris Fashion Week</h3>
				<p>Paris Fashion Week is a clothing trade show held biannually in Paris, France with spring/summer and autumn/winter events held each year. Dates are determined 
				by the French Fashion Federation. Currently, Fashion Week is held in the Carrousel du Louvre, as well as at various other venues throughout the city.</p>
				<p>Paris Fashion Week is part of the global "Big 4" fashion weeks, the others being London Fashion Week, Milan Fashion Week and New York Fashion Week.The 
				schedule begins with New York, followed by London, and then Milan and ends in Paris.</p>
				<p>In 2013, Paris Fashion Week (spring/summer season) started September 26 with Lucien Pellat Finet, and was followed by shows from major fashion houses such 
				as Guy Laroche, Dries Van Noten, Comme des Gar√ßons, Christian Dior, Lanvin, Isabel Marant, Sonia Rykiel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Balenciaga, and more. These runway
				shows are held to show the fashion industry what the various labels will be releasing and to increase sales for the brands.</p>
				<p>In addition to ready-to-wear shows, there are men's and haute couture shows, which are held semiannually for the spring/summer and autumn/winter seasons.</p>
