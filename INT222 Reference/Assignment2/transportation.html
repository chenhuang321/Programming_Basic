			<h2>Transportation in Paris</h2>
			<aside class="introduction">
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>The Paris transportation network of buses, trams, Métro, Autoroutes, trains and planes connect between Paris's many different districts 
			and beyond.<br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson" target="_blank" title="click me to get more information">&gt;&gt;
			&gt;&nbsp;Is that all?&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></p>

			<h3>Global Reviews</h3>
			<h4>solopes:</h4>
			<p>Many attractions are close to the river, and for those with displacing problems, short time, or the need of a different angle, there are 
			several boat trips along the river, easy to deal and book locally.<br/>You just have to choose your program.

			<h4>pieter_jan_v:</h4>
			<p>he cheapest option is buying a daily ticket for 1.70€ and use Vélib as often as you want during 24 hours!The deposit is 
			150€ and will be paid back after proper return of the bicycle. The first 30 minutes of each trip are always free of charge.

			<h4>shrimp56:</h4>
			<p>More often than not I take the Roissybus from the airport to Opera where I catch the metro, usually to my haunts in the 7eme. It cost
			under 10 euro, often provides a nice tour of the back streets of Montmartre on the way in and deposits you right behind the Opera Garnier on rue Scribe. 
			Can't beat that! And you don't have to worry about the pickpockets on the RER.

			<h3>Metro</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metro is the ideal way to get around Paris fast and easily. There are 16 lines (including 2 "bis") traversing the city. Each line has 
			a different color and number. So even if the abundance of lines appears overwhelming when you first look at a metro map, it quickly becomes easy 
			when you understand how it works. At any given Metro station each Metro line will have 2 platforms, one for each direction.  Each direction is 
			marked by its terminus station, the last station on the line.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon descending into a Metro station line platform, find a Metro map located on the platform wall.  Find the 
			current station you're at and then find the station you're traveling to.  Once you find the destination station on the map, follow the Metro line to 
			its end, the terminus, which will be the direction name you're after for this Metro line.  By keeping the terminus stations in mind when switching 
			Metro lines, you'll know which lines  and in which directions you must travel to get to your destination.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A table with current metro ticket prices can be found below, but as the table indicates it gets cheaper if 
			you buy 10 at a time (local's call it a “carnet”). Then you have a large choice of different passes (1 or several days, 1 week, or even 1 month:
			pass navigo) which are really convenient and cheaper than purchasing individual tickets. Note that, if you don’t have a pass, each ticket is valid 
			only for one trip (including changes within the Metro system).<a href="http://parisbytrain.com/paris-metro/" title="click me to get more information" target="_blank">

			<h3>Buses</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buses are also a great option as they allow you to see and enjoy the city while moving around. There are so many 
			buses in Paris, you can go almost everywhere by bus. The only issue is to find where they stop! Bus stops are more tricky to find than metro stations. 
			Tickets are the same as the ones you use in the metro.  The bus fare structure was recently (July 2007) changed to allow limited transfers between buses.
			A "t+" ticket (which is what you will receive if you buy a carnet in a Metro station) allows transfers among buses for up to 90 minutes from the first trip.  
			However, if you buy a ticket on board the bus, there are no transfers. Also, there are no transfers between bus and metro.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep in mind that the Parisian metro stops between 12.30 and 1 am, and buses usually stop between 9 and 10 pm, with 
			reduced service continuing with night buses and Noctilien buses. Always look for your night bus itinerary before using it. <a href="http://eng.bigbustours.com/paris/tickets-and-prices.html"

			<h3>Boats</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a tour of Paris by boat is unparalleled as romantic experiences go. The city seems to be fanned out 
			before you as you lazily drift down the Seine River or Paris' miles-long network of canals.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>By taking one of these popular tours</strong>, you can get a glimpse of some of the city's most mythical spots, 
			enjoy a romantic dinner amid the soft glow of light on the water, or just sit back and revel in the fresh air and delicious floating in a scenic setting.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best time is generally May through mid-September, when skies tend to be clearer and temperatures in Paris 
			are generally warm. Fall and winter tours are still worthwhile, but keep in mind that wind from off the water and frequent rain can make sitting 
			on the open-air deck less than desirable.<a href="http://goparis.about.com/od/sightsattractions/a/Paris_Boat_Tour.htm"

			<h3>Velib/Cycling</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost free bicycle system in Paris, called VELIB (a contraction of Velo = Bike, and Libre = Free), is an 
			excellent way to get around the Paris, particularly for short trips.  You can find more information about the system on the official website, or at 
			their wikipedia page (perhaps easier for English speakers).</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bikes are sturdy, heavy and strong, with 3 gears. The only adjustment available is the seat height. 
			The bikes come with simple locks; just pop the cable end of the lock into the slot and you can take the key with you. But usually there are enough 
			stations around the city that you can just return the bike right away, and hop on another one when you need to.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Velib stations all have handy maps of the area, which also show the location of the other nearest Velib 
			stations - which is useful as occasionally the whole station will not be working - no bikes will be left to take out, or in some cases, there are no
			free spaces left to return the bikes!</p>
