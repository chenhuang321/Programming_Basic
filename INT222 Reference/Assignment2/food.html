				<h2>Food in Paris</h2>
				<h3>What Do French People Eat</h3>
				<p>The easy answer to the question "What do French people eat?," is that they eat just about everything. In France, like in most developed 
				countries, there are meat lovers and vegetarians, and there are people who prefer salty and others who prefer sweet. However, aspects 
				surrounding food in France set the country apart from other countries.</p>

					<h3>History of Food in France</h3>
					<p>Food is a very important part of life in France, which makes it also a very important part of French culture. While the British are known for their 
					afternoon tea and the Americans are known for their bottomless buffets, the French are known for long, lingering meals that feature several courses. 
					This food culture is an integral part of daily life in France.<br/>

					<h3>Carrefour, Paris</h3>
					<p>Carrefour is a French multinational retailer headquartered in Boulogne Billancourt, France, in Greater Paris.
					It is one of the largest hypermarket chains in the world (with 1,452 hypermarkets at the end of 2011), the fourth largest retail group in the world in 
					terms of revenue (after Wal-Mart, Tesco and Costco), and the third in profit (after Wal-Mart and Tesco).<br/>

					<h3>Coffee Culture</h3>
					<p>If you think ordering coffee in a French café or bar is the same as back home, you might be in for an unpleasant surprise. 
					Ask for un café and you'll be presented with a tiny cup of espresso, and if you then request milk, you're likely to get a dirty look or sigh of 
					exasperation. What's the problem?</p>

					<h3>Wine Culture</h3>
					<p>French wines can be complicated but at Wine & Beyond, we strive to make shopping French wines easy and exciting. France offers some of the world’s 
					greatest wines with excellent variety and value. Most of the entire renowned grape varietals available today were sourced from France from Cabernet 
					Sauvignon to Sauvignon Blanc.</p>
					<p>All French wines are classified and labelled according to the “Appellation d’Origine Controlee” system or “AOC” for short. This system ensures 
					authenticity and that the grapes are grown in the area stated on the label. Usually, the smaller the place where a wine is named from, the higher it’s 
					rank. This pyramid has the levels from highest quality (top) to the lowest.</p>
					<p>In France, wines are typically named after the vineyard or growing region where they were produced instead of the grape varietals.
